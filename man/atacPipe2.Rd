}
\arguments{
\item{case}{\code{List} scalar. Input for case sample. \code{fastqInput1},
the path of the mate 1 fastq file, is required. \code{fastqInput2},
the path of the mate 2 fastq file, is required, when \code{interleave=FALSE}.
\code{adapter1} and \code{adapter2} are optional.}

\item{control}{\code{List} scalar. Input for control sample. \code{fastqInput1},
the path of the mate 1 fastq file, is required. \code{fastqInput2},
the path of the mate 2 fastq file, is required, when \code{interleave=FALSE}.
\code{adapter1} and \code{adapter2} are optional.}

\item{interleave}{\code{Logical}. Set \code{TRUE} when files are
interleaved paired-end sequencing data.}

\item{createReport}{\code{Logical}. If the HTML report file will be created.}
}
\value{
An invisible \code{\link{ATACProc}} object scalar for downstream analysis.
}
\description{
The pipeline to process case control study sequencing data
into destination files including
a HTML report file reads storage files (BED BAM)
and various quality control report files.
