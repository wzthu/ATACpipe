\title{Find the overlap or differential peaks between two samples.}
\usage{
atacpeakComp(atacProcPeak1, atacProcPeak2, bedInput1 = NULL,
  bedInput2 = NULL, bedOutput = NULL, olap.rate = 0.2, ...)

\S4method{atacpeakComp}{ATACProc}(atacProcPeak1, atacProcPeak2,
  bedInput1 = NULL, bedInput2 = NULL, bedOutput = NULL, olap.rate = 0.2,
  ...)

peakcomp(bedInput1 = NULL, bedInput2 = NULL, bedOutput = NULL,
  olap.rate = 0.2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{atacProcPeak1}{\code{\link{ATACProc-class}} object scalar.
It has to be the return value of upstream process:
\code{\link{atacPeakCalling}}.}

\item{atacProcPeak2}{\code{\link{ATACProc-class}} object scalar.
It has to be the return value of upstream process:
\code{\link{atacPeakCalling}}.}

\item{bedInput1}{\code{Character} scalar.
Input peak file path. UCSC bed file is recommented. Other file should be
able to import as \link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges} objects through
\link[rtracklayer]{import}.}

\item{bedInput2}{\code{Character} scalar.
Input peak file path. UCSC bed file is recommented. Other file should be
able to import as \link[GenomicRanges]{GRanges} objects through
\link[rtracklayer]{import}.}

\item{bedOutput}{The output file path. File name order: bedInput1 specific
peaks, bedInput2 specific peaks, overlap peaks.}

\item{olap.rate}{Overlap rate, if the overlap region between 2 peak is more
than this rate of the short peak, these two peak are considered to be
overlap and will be merged to a bigger peak. Default: 0.2. NOTICE: multi-peak will be
merged together!}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, currently unused.}
}
\value{
An invisible \code{\link{ATACProc-class}} object scalar for
downstream analysis.
}
\description{
This function compares two peak file and report overlap or differential peaks
according to the parameter "operation".
