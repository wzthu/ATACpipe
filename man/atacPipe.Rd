\title{Pipeline for single replicate}
\usage{
atacPipe(fastqInput1, fastqInput2 = NULL, adapter1 = NULL,
  adapter2 = NULL, interleave = FALSE, createReport = TRUE,
  prefix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fastqInput1}{\code{Character} vector. For single-end sequencing,
it contains sequence file paths.
For paired-end sequencing, it can be file paths with #1 mates paired
with file paths in fastqInput2
And it can also be interleaved file paths when argument
interleaved=\code{TRUE}}

\item{fastqInput2}{\code{Character} vector. It contains file paths with #2
mates paired with file paths in fastqInput1
For single-end sequencing files and interleaved paired-end sequencing
files(argument interleaved=\code{TRUE}),
it must be \code{NULL}.}

\item{adapter1}{\code{Character}. It is an adapter sequence for file1.
For single end data, it is requied.}

\item{adapter2}{\code{Character}. It is an adapter sequence for file2.}

\item{interleave}{\code{Logical}. Set \code{TRUE} when files are
interleaved paired-end sequencing data.}

\item{createReport}{\code{Logical}. If the HTML report file will be created.}

\item{prefix}{For identifying files.}
}
\value{
An invisible \code{\link{ATACProc}} object scalar for downstream analysis.
}
\description{
The pipeline to process sequencing data into destination files including
a HTML report file reads storage files (BED BAM)
and various quality control report files.
